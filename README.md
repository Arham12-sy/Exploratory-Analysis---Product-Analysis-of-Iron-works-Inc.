## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings
The Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard presents an in-depth view of product sales from 2019 to 2022, with total sales of approximately $4.6 million and monthly sales ranging from $144 to $8.3K. The top-performing product is the Automotive Hub Assembly (~$0.657M), while the lowest performer is the Drum Brake (~$0.632M). Among categories, Heavy Duty Drum Brakes contributed to roughly 14% of total sales. January 2023 experienced a significant spike, likely due to seasonal vehicle failures, post-holiday maintenance, and winter-related repairs, indicating company-wide or macro-level impacts on sales.

The dashboard highlights seasonal and temporal trends, showing that sales peaked in January, June, August, and October 2021, with a notable drop in November 2022. Cast Iron Brake and Machine Iron Casting saw their largest price dip in January 2022. These patterns emphasize the importance of strategic promotions, pricing adjustments, and timing marketing efforts to align with historical sales trends. Additionally, Direct and Mobile channels emerged as primary revenue drivers, supporting increased investment and resource allocation for these channels.

The analysis also provides geographical and category-level insights. North America consistently shows the highest sales, suggesting the need to prioritize inventory, marketing, and retention strategies in that region. Conversely, the UK exhibits the lowest performance, signaling opportunities to reassess pricing, distribution, and localized marketing. Across all products, similar dips were observed in November 2022, and annual price spikes occur across multiple years, indicating consistent seasonal effects. These insights support data-driven decision-making for pricing, promotions, and operational planning.
